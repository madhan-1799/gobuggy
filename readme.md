# Travel Planner

## Mini-Project Synopsis

**Advanced Programming Lab (ICT 3166)**

### 1. Project Title: Travel Planner

### 2. Abstract

The aim of our project is to create an all-in-one model for customers to help them plan their trips efficiently. This includes selecting cities, exploring places, attractions, restaurants, booking hotels, calculating expenses, and more. The system is designed to save users time and streamline their travel planning experience.

### 3. Project Details

The project consists of three main interfaces:

-   **User Interface**: Users can log in to browse a list of cities, attractions, and restaurants. They can view details and add items to their cart based on their preferences.
    
-   **Moderator Interface**: Moderators have the ability to edit place and location details as per real-time updates.
    
-   **Administrator Interface**: Admins can manage and oversee moderators and users, ensuring smooth operation of the system.
    

### 4. Expected Result

The expected outcome is to develop a fully functional travel booking model, similar to platforms like MakeMyTrip. The project aims to deliver a user-friendly and intuitive interface, ensuring a seamless experience for trip planning. Additionally, through this project, we aim to enhance our understanding of Python as a development language and its associated tools.
